I found that I quickly gained access to the host but was stuck trying to find a way to excalate an unprivileged account to root. Local scans made it seem like there maybe were a few ways to reach root though I ended up achieving the escalation via a kernel exploit that I&amp;rsquo;d never had the opportunity to attempt yet.</description></item><item><title>Internal Boot2Root Write-Up</title><link>https://packetfire.org/post/internal-boot2root-writeup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://packetfire.org/post/internal-boot2root-writeup/</guid><description>Introduction: The Internal host took almost 24 hours to complete due to the sheer number of pivots required to complete it. Unlike many of the other boot2roots I&amp;rsquo;ve completed on THM, this host required a significant amount of review and manual poking around on the host, above and beyond the results of automated enumeration tools like linPEAS. I thought it was incredibly brilliant machine.

It was incredibly easy to rabbithole down paths if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t diligent both in thinking about how to collect information but in documenting the information that I had gathered. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk through my experience in tackling this challenge and especially focus on the rabbitholes I fell victim to, however it may be difficult to fully capture the amount of time spent in these in writing.</description></item><item><title>Hackpark Boot2Root Write-Up</title><link>https://packetfire.org/post/hackpark-boot2-root-writeup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://packetfire.org/post/hackpark-boot2-root-writeup/</guid><description>Introduction: The Hackpark challenge was deceptively simple in the initial exploratory phase. I had gained a ton of ground early on while I established a foothold on the host but discovering a pivot point from a low-privileged user to System took me significantly longer, primarily due to my unfamiliarity with Windows.

On my first pass, I overlooked the NFS server which really impressed the importance of carefully reviewing scans.

My main goal is to balance understanding how to effectively perform an attack with the awesome frameworks out there like metasploit while gaining a better understanding of what this framework is doing under the hood. This post is the first of many that will follow me documenting both the attacks and my methodologies.</description></item></channel></rss>
