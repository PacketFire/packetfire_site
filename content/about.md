The Packetfire project is a mentoring-minded virtual hackerspace, originally growing from an IRC community started in 2011 by Mark Agarunov. Over time this community has grown to offer free project hosting and operational support, and many free services in addition to the chat-centeralized community. Currently the project is maintained by Mark Agarunov and Nate Catelli.
